#!/usr/bin/env msh


### dont allow ___msh, because this will fuck up things? loop or recursive or something.


### i should have a second delimiter, in case a lang uses the first one, like ```, and then maybe also +_ or something
### vscode plugin to show which block of code im in. which lang, or no lang.



___js
if (process.env.CI === true) {
    ___bash
	echo "we are in CI"
    ___
} else {
___bash
	echo "no CI over here"
___
}
___


### is inlining even possible? if not, lets fine a pattern, to do an if in one lang, and conditionally call another block
### maybe it could be like:
___js
return process.env.CI === true
___ >inCI

if inCI {
___bash
	echo "we are in CI"
___
} else {
___bash
	echo "no CI over here"
___
}
