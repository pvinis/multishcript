### i should have a second delimiter, in case a lang uses the first one, like ```, and then maybe also +_ or something
### vscode plugin to show which block of code im in. which lang, or no lang.



___js
if (process.env === true) {

___bash
	./scripts/setup-distribute
___

}
___


### is inlining even possible? if not, lets fine a pattern, to do an if in one lang, and conditionally call another block
### maybe it could be like:
___js
return process.env === true
___ >inCI

if inCI {
___bash
	./scripts/setup-distribute
___
}
